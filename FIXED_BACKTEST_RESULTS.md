## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Trading Thresholds** ✅
```python
# BEFORE (Too restrictive)
min_confidence_score = 0.75
signal_strength >= 3
quality_threshold = 0.70

# AFTER (Balanced)
min_confidence_score = 0.60  # Reduced from 0.75
signal_strength >= 2         # Reduced from 3
quality_threshold = 0.55     # Reduced from 0.70
```

### **2. Signal Generation Logic** ✅
```python
# BEFORE: Required perfect conditions
if (signal_agreement AND timeframe_agreement >= 2 AND cross_asset_confirmation):
    trade = True

# AFTER: Scoring system with flexibility
signal_score = confidence + strength + timeframes + cross_asset
if signal_score >= 6:  # More reasonable threshold
    trade = True
```

### **3. Risk Management Balance** ✅
```python
# BEFORE: Ultra-conservative
if confidence < 0.70 OR strength < 3: reject_trade()

# AFTER: Risk-adjusted flexibility  
if confidence < max(0.50, threshold * 0.9): reject_trade()
```

### **4. Position Sizing Optimization** ✅
```python
# Enhanced regime-based adjustments
TRENDING_BULL: 1.3x     # Take advantage of trends
RANGING_LOW_VOL: 1.1x   # Safe environment for trading
EXTREME_VOLATILITY: 0.6x # Still trade but reduced size
```
