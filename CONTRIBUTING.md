## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tools

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/binance-triangular-arbitrage-bot.git
cd binance-triangular-arbitrage-bot

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=arbitrage_bot

pytest tests/test_arbitrage_bot.py

# Run linting
flake8 src/
mypy src/arbitrage_bot
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints for all functions and methods

### Code Quality

- **Security First**: All code must be security-reviewed
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling
- **Logging**: Appropriate logging levels and sanitization
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% test coverage for new code

### Trading Logic Standards

- **Safety Checks**: Always validate inputs and balances
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits
- **Risk Management**: Implement proper safeguards
- **Documentation**: Clear docstrings for trading functions

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add support for new trading pairs
fix: resolve WebSocket reconnection issue
docs: update deployment guide
test: add tests for profit calculation

```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test all public methods
- Mock external dependencies (Binance API, WebSocket)
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use meaningful test names

### Integration Tests

- Test complete trading workflows
- Use Binance testnet for API integration tests
- Test WebSocket connection handling
- Test Telegram notifications

### Security Tests

- Test API key sanitization
- Verify no secrets in logs
- Test input validation
- Test rate limiting

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Clear docstrings for all functions/classes
- Include parameter types and return types
- Document exceptions that can be raised
- Include usage examples for complex functions

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update deployment guides for configuration changes
- Include migration guides for breaking changes
- Add examples for new features

## Security Guidelines

### Critical Rules

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables
2. **Sanitize all outputs**: Especially error messages and logs
3. **Validate all inputs**: From users and external APIs
4. **Test security features**: Include security tests
5. **Review carefully**: All trading logic must be reviewed

### Trading Safety

1. **Testnet first**: All trading features must work on testnet
2. **Small amounts**: Test with minimal amounts initially
3. **Rate limiting**: Respect all API limits
4. **Error recovery**: Handle partial failures gracefully
5. **Balance protection**: Never trade more than intended
