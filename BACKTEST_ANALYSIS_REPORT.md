3. **Aggressive Approach** (Production): High activity, higher drawdown

---

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **Phase 1: Threshold Calibration**
```python
# Institutional Bot Adjustments
min_confidence_score = 0.60  # Reduce from 0.75
min_signal_strength = 2      # Reduce from 3
quality_threshold = 0.60     # Reduce from 0.70
```

### **Phase 2: Market Regime Adaptation**
```python
# Dynamic Thresholds by Market Condition
if market_regime == "RANGING":
    min_confidence = 0.55    # Lower bar for ranging markets
elif market_regime == "TRENDING": 
    min_confidence = 0.70    # Higher bar for trends
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Position Sizing**
```python
# Kelly Criterion with Bootstrap
position_size = kelly_base * confidence_multiplier * regime_multiplier
```
